      <p>Zach is a pleasure to work with, a passionate engineer who
      has great instincts and technical understanding.</p>
      <p>He is an invaluable steward for the infra team’s platform.
      He cares deeply for the engineering experience, seeking input
      from our product engineers to help inform decision making and
      product direction with an eye towards ease of use and
      maintainability.</p>
      <p>I think it is important to point out that everyone who
      gave feedback expressed joy and pleasure working with Zach,
      appreciated his dedication, and was committed to wanting to
      help him continue to grow and succeed. This was fairly unique
      in my experience and I think is a reflection of Zach as a
      person.</p>

    <p>I build tools that help programmers work faster and with
    less frustration. I try to focus on "scratching my own itch"
    because it makes the work more satisfying and means I build
    more intuitive tools. I find that working in close relationship
    with the users of my tools has similar benefits. This
    relational approach is especially well-suited to small teams
    and developer-tools companies, where I can directly engage with
    those wielding the tools I build.</p>
    <p>In these relationships, I focus on understanding understand
    how developers or users work and what slows them down. I build
    smaller fixes while designing systemic changes to address
    present-day problems as well as deeper long-term issues.
    Sharing my work throughout helps me stay attuned to users'
    needs.</p>
    <p>My work is informed by a long history of building productive
    public relationships with people, both inside and outside of
    software. I've been building software for people I know (both
    friends and colleagues) for five years, so I have plenty
    practice working out what they need and implementing it. For
    full project descriptions <a href=
    "/static/Sherman_resume.pdf">see my resume</a>. Some examples
    are: the <a href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok</a> developer
    environment and associated tooling which I've maintained for
    the past three years and miscellaneous dev tools at <a href=
    "https://replit.com/community/all">repl.it</a> and open work
    labs. I also <a href=
    "https://git.sr.ht/~radioalice/e-worm.club">built</a> <a href=
    "https://e-worm.club">e-worm.club</a> a few years ago. It's a
    social site just for my friends that's been through several
    iterations before I settled on something like a private, more
    user-friendly <a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>.
    Building these tools has taught me a ton about working in the
    messy space in between people and software.</p>
    <p>I owe much of my focus on building relationships to the four
    years I spent as a community organizer in Chicago. Community
    organizing focuses on identifying the root causes of community
    issues and bringing people together to fix them. In my software
    work I rely on the same kinds of high-trust relationships to
    identify the deeper causes of developer friction and build
    tools to address them.</p>
