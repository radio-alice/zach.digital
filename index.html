      <p>Zach is a pleasure to work with, a passionate engineer who
      has great instincts and technical understanding.</p>
      <p>He is an invaluable steward for the infra team’s platform.
      He cares deeply for the experience of his fellow engineers
      and reliably seeks their input to inform product direction.
      In this work he especially values ease of use and
      maintainability.</p>
      <p>I think it is important to point out that everyone who
      gave feedback expressed joy and pleasure working with Zach,
      appreciated his dedication, and committed to help him
      continue to grow and succeed. This was fairly unique in my
      experience and I think is a reflection of Zach as a
      person.</p>

    <p>Software development requires some skill with computers and
    even more skill with people. Much of my relational experience
    comes from four years community-organizing in Chicago. I fought
    side-by-side with college kids and old south-siders to better
    our community. We came together to understand the root causes
    of injustice which fueled our campaigns for universal
    healthcare, climate action, and ending police brutality. In
    software I rely on similar high-trust relationships. In deep
    collaboration, I identify the root causes of friction and build
    tools to address them. Zen practice also informs my work: it's
    much easier to understand others with a little understanding of
    myself.</p>
    <p>Here's my approach to software development. I build tools
    that help people work faster and with less frustration. I focus
    on "scratching my own itch" because it makes the work more
    satisfying and means I build more intuitive tools. Working in
    close relationship with the users of my tools helps a lot too.
    In these relationships, I focus on understanding how developers
    or users work and what slows them down. I build smaller fixes
    to address present-day problems while designing systemic
    changes that address longer-term issues. Sharing my work
    throughout helps me stay attuned to users' needs.</p>
    <p>I work best when I can directly engage the people using my
    software. So my skillset is best suited to places that
    encourage that engagement, like small teams and developer-tools
    companies.</p>
    <p>I've been building software for people I know (both friends
    and colleagues) for five years, so I have plenty practice
    working out what they need and implementing it. For full
    project descriptions <a href="/static/Sherman_resume.pdf">see
    my resume</a>. Some highlights:</p>
    <ul class="stack">
      <li>
        <b>developer environments:</b> I maintain the <a href=
        "https://ngrok.com">ngrok</a> developer environment and
        associated tooling using nix/nixos, golang, typescript,
        bash, systemd.
      </li>
      <li><b>CI systems:</b> I lead ngrok's CI development and
      maintenance using nix/nixos, bash, typescript (as a way to
      programmatically generate YAML for pipeline configurations),
      CircleCI, DroneCI, buildkite (we stuck with buildkite).</li>
      <li><b>environment configuration:</b> I lead the ongoing
      design and maintenance of a custom typescript program that
      allows developers to change environment, cluster, service
      configurations and infrastructure without diving into YAML
      (or terraform) hell. Like a very fancy version of helm. This
      involves kubernetes manifests, terraform, dockerfiles, and a
      whole lot of fun with the typescript type system for maximum
      <i>ergonomics</i>.</li>
      <li><b>agent packaging:</b> I developed and maintain docker,
      snap, homebrew, and chocolatey packages for the ngrok agent.
      I automated releases with go and buildkite.</li>
      <li><b>observability:</b> I have experience operating vector
      (logging), veneur and datadog agents (metrics), and
      otel-collector and refinery with honeycomb for tracing
      data.</li>
      <li>
        <b>e-worm.club:</b> I also <a href=
        "https://git.sr.ht/~radioalice/e-worm.club">built</a>
        <a href="https://e-worm.club">e-worm.club</a> a few years
        ago. It's a social site just for my friends that's been
        through several iterations before I settled on something
        like a private, more user-friendly <a href=
        "http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>. Using async rust! which
        was very fancy back in 2020.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>miscellaneous dev tools:</b> ...built as an engineer at
        <a href="https://replit.com/community/all">repl.it</a> and
        open work labs using typescript, react, redux.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Building these tools has taught me a ton about working in
    the messy space in between people and software.</p><br>
