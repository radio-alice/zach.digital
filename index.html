          <p>I build tools that help programmers work faster and
          with less frustration. The best tools are built by people
          "scratching their own itch" because they possess unique
          insight into what the user needs. This sort of empathy is
          crucial to my work; with a deep understanding of
          developer needs, I can build tools that help maximize the
          performance of software companies' most expensive asset-
          developer time. This approach is especially well-suited
          to small teams and developer-tools companies. In these
          environments, deeply understanding your users' work is a
          competitive advantage that you can't afford to pass
          up.</p>
          <p>My work is built on the following practices: I build
          relationships with developers to understand how they work
          and what slows them down. I propose solutions and develop
          quick fixes; continuously sharing my work helps me stay
          aligned with developer needs. These practices comprise a
          continuous cycle that drives my work.</p>
          <p>As programmers, we often reach for software to solve
          our problems. But sometimes changing human practices,
          like encouraging people to use feature flags or to use
          traces instead of logs, solves issues more quickly than
          off-loading the problem entirely to software. I have
          found that most problems facing developers require both
          new tools and new practices.</p>
          <p>My work is informed by a long history of building
          relationships with people to solve important problems,
          both inside and outside of software. I've been building
          software for people I know (both friends and colleagues)
          for four years, so I have plenty practice working out
          what they need and implementing it. Some examples are:
          the <a href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok</a> developer
          environment and associated tooling which I've maintained
          for the past year and miscellaneous dev tools at <a href=
          "https://replit.com/community/all">repl.it</a> and open
          work labs. I also have been working on <a href=
          "https://e-worm.club">e-worm.club</a> for the past few
          years. It's a social site built just for my friends
          that's been through several iterations before I settled
          on something like a private, more user-friendly <a href=
          "http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>. Through building
          these tools, I learned how to understand my users and
          developed the technical knowledge to build tools to meet
          their needs.</p>
          <p>I owe my relational skills to the four years I spent
          as a community organizer in Chicago. Community organizing
          is all about uncovering the root causes of community
          issues and helping people collaborate to fix them. I use
          the same skills of empathy, establishing trust, and
          building relationships to help solve the issues facing my
          fellow developers.</p>
