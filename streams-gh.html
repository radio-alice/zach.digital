        Through a series of interviews with companies building open-source
        software, we found that they have a lot of difficulty tracking and
        organizing their work. Also there lack a simple way to ambiently capture
        and share that work. Our goal was to turn organizing and sharing work
        into a continuous, passive process. We wanted to replace the "hey just
        updated this doc" or "just PRed that branch" slack messages with a tool
        that updates teammates automatically and enables more asynchronous work.
        In its early iterations, Streams was an experimental product that
        created shareable feeds of your GitHub events for any given repository.

        I led a series of iterative design sprints– sketching, wireframing,
        prototyping, and user-testing a variety of organizational schemes for a
        team’s GitHub events. Along the way, we learned that filtering and
        grouping the firehose of data is crucial to its usefulness (people do a
        lot on GitHub). I also tried out a bunch of different UI tricks to
        filter out information, while making that data easily accessible through
        user interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these experiments, I was entirely responsible for the visual design
        and its implementation. I also contributed significantly to prior user
        research, application logic (React + Redux), and user-testing. If I had
        to do it again, I would test Figma prototypes first instead of fully
        built web apps.
