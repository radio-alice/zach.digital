        client so that my friends and I can have a cute, self-hosted social
        network to post about politics and art. Besides being much more visually
        interesting than our facebook messenger groupchat, e-worm also attempts
        to solve design problems around conversational, collaborative thinking.
        The biggest of these problems is the inherent ephemerality of our
        groupchat— it doesn’t really succeed as a collaborative thinking space
        because it has no long-term memory. When messages are constantly buried
        under new ones, it places the burden on us to remember previous
        conversations. So the ultimate design goal for e-worm is to create a
        self-archiving conversational interface that preserves thought and helps
        us keep thinking new things rather than going in intellectual circles.
      </p>
      <p>
        One idea I’m testing is emphasizing threads in the UI to force us to
        delineate our conversations rather than having an unparseable monolithic
        stream of consciousness (as in our current groupchat). These threads
        currently have top-level tags that are chosen from a few preset options
        when the first post is added. No one has really been making use of
        these, so I’m in the process of testing out other options.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also plan to add an ‘export to
        <a href="http://are.na" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >are.na</a
        >’ button on each thread that will create a channel from the thread with
        each message as a ‘block’. Higher level channels will categorize these
        ‘thread’ channels by subject. I chose are.na because its interface
        encourages a sort of public digital memory that I haven’t found with any
        other software. Are.na itself doesn’t have the
        <em>conversational</em> UI that I think is necessary for a real-time
        collaborative thinking tool— it’s interface is more about discovering
        and connecting than communicating directly. I’m still sketching out
        ideas for how to better tie these two interfaces (e-worm conversation
        and are.na archive) into one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UI is completely navigable by keyboard shortcuts, which can be
        viewed by holding down the ‘control’ key.
