        I forked
        <a href="https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite" target="_blank"
          >etherpad-lite</a
        >, so my friends and I could have a collaborative docs app that was
        actually fun to use
      </p>

        This wasn’t a particularly in-depth UX exercise, but it highlights how I
        use aesthetics to encourage certain modes of interaction. The original
        etherpad interface was plain and conservative, but we (the
        collaborators) are whacked out and radical. Aesthetics set the tone of
        interaction and I believe that they should mirror the goals of the
        interface, not fight it. The goals of this interface were (similar to
        e-worm.club) to create a space for radical, non-linear, collaborative
        thinking that would preserve those thoughts rather than cast them aside.
        These sorts of interactions would have been oddly dissonant with the
        original etherpad interface but were harmonious with (and even
        encouraged by) my version.
      </p>
      <p>
        If "beautiful interfaces" were an objective standard than we wouldn’t
        have UI design trends— I choose aesthetics based on the feelings and
        interactions I want to encourage, not some handwavey notion of beauty or
        what’s popular on dribble.
