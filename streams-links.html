        The goal of this sprint was much the same as the previous: design a
        product for sharing your work with collaborators. This time, I tried
        substituting the work of api integrations (e.g. GitHub) with manual
        updates by users themselves. If people desperately needed a way to view
        all their team’s work in one place, would they be willing to manually
        report when they had edited docs or pushed code?
      </p>
      <p>
        For this sprint I decided to validate the hypothesis with the Figma
        prototype itself. I created the initial (paper) sketches, wireframes and
        80% of the figma mockup and was completely responsible for user-testing.
        I tried to use the onboarding flow to ease users into the understanding
        the full UI, by presenting a vastly simplified step-by-step walkthrough
        of sharing updates with a teammate. I then expose the entire UI with the
        corresponding parts of the ‘compose’ window filled in, so that users can
        easily see map the questions they answered in onboarding onto the
        full-fledged UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found that, no, people do not need something like this badly enough to
        go through the effort of manual updates– unless their work is spread
        between like eight to ten apps with no integrations between any of them.
        Document-specific updates take place within their respective apps (i.e.
        GitHub or Google docs) and via Slack or a project-management tool. A
        single place to view all of your team’s work was not valuable enough to
        convince people to construct that place manually with yet another app.
